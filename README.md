# Poster

This is an application I developed to learn more about full-stack development. I used React on the front-end, Node/Express for the backend stateless server, and MongoDB as a database to store user data. It's a web application similar to Twitter allowing users to create and view other users posts. This repository stores the front-end code.

### Note: 
Although the application supports file uploads for images, the service used to host the backend server does not allow these types of file uploads but the application still works without images.
